	<hr>

	<h2>Add to Cart Page</h2>
	<p>The Add to Cart (Shopping Bag) page is the main review and confirmation step before checkout. It lets users see all items they’ve selected, adjust quantities, apply coupons, choose the delivery address, optionally add recommended items or a donation, and then proceed to payment in a single, focused flow.</p>
	<div class="ms-4">

		<h4>Page purpose and layout</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The page is divided into three vertical zones:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Cart Items Area on the left (all dishes in the cart).</li>
					<li>Order Summary Sidebar on the right (coupon, address, totals, checkout).</li>
					<li>Donation & Policy Section at the bottom (optional donation and detailed cancellation policy).​</li>
				</ol>

			</li>
			<li>The top of the page shows the Shopping Bag title, the item count, and a Clear Cart button to reset the cart in one action.​</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Cart items workflow</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Each cart line shows the dish image, name, description, star rating, unit price, quantity control, and total, so users can understand and manage every item easily.​</li>
			<li>The initial quantity comes from wherever the user last added/updated that item (menu page or detail page).</li>
			<li>
				<p>Users can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Increase quantity with the plus button, which updates the line total and overall cart total in real time.</li>
					<li>Decrease quantity with the minus button; if the quantity reaches zero, the item is removed from the cart.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Any change in quantity immediately updates the cart item count and the Cart Total / Total figures in the sidebar, keeping pricing transparent.​</li>
		</ul>


		<h4>Recommendations / Add more items</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Below the main list cart items, a strip shows recommended dishes (e.g., Butter Naan, another curry), each with an image, name, short description, rating, price, and an “+ Add” button.</li>
			<li>Clicking “+ Add” adds that item to the cart with a default quantity of 1, updates totals, and visually confirms the addition (for example, button state change or toast), allowing quick upsell without leaving the cart.​</li>
		</ul>


		<h4>Coupon, address and totals workflow</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>In the right sidebar, the Coupon Code panel lets users enter a code and tap Apply.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On valid codes, the Discount value and Total are recalculated and updated; an error state appears for invalid/expired codes.​</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>The Deliver block shows the currently selected address (name, address, phone) and a navigation arrow.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tapping it opens the address management flow, where users can change or add addresses; when they return, the selected address is reflected here.​</li>
				</ul>
			</li>


			<li>
				<p>The Cart Total panel displays a breakdown:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cart total (sum of item line totals).</li>
					<li>Delivery charge.</li>
					<li>Discount (from coupons/offers).</li>
					<li>Total (final payable amount).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>The Checkout button is the primary call‑to‑action, moving the user from this review page to the checkout/payment flow once they are satisfied with items, address, and totals.​</li>
		</ul>

	</div>
	<p>This information helps users feel secure and informed about their purchase, making it easier for them to complete the order without hesitation.</p>

	<hr />


	<h2>Coupon Page & Redeem Pop-up</h2>
	<p>The Coupon List page displays all available offers in a clean, card-based grid, allowing users to quickly browse and select the best deal for their order. Each coupon appears as a colourful card with the coupon title at the top (for example, WELCOME50, FREEMEAL, WEEKLY20), the internal code repeated in the lower section, a one-line benefit description (such as “Get 50% off on your first order” or “Free delivery on orders above ₹299”), and an expiry date so users know how long the offer is valid. A small “Text” label in the corner indicates the type of coupon, maintaining a consistent visual format across all cards.</p>
	<p>By scrolling the grid, users can see different categories of offers like first-order discounts, referral rewards, zero-fee delivery, healthy-meal promos, festival specials, and student or loyalty benefits, each distinguished by its own background colour. This makes it easy to visually scan and pick an offer that matches their situation (new user, subscriber, student, etc.). When a user taps a card, the system opens a detailed coupon pop-up overlay focused on that single offer and ready for redemption.</p>

	<div class="ms-4">
		<h4>Coupon Detail Pop-up</h4>
		<p>The Coupon Detail Pop-up is an overlay that appears centred on top of the coupon list when a coupon is selected, giving a focused, full-size view of one specific offer. At the top, it shows the partner or brand logo (for example, GPay) and a short headline line describing the benefit in natural language, such as “20% cashback on all rides globally via Standard Chartered credit card,” so users immediately understand what they get. Below a dotted separator, the pop-up highlights the Coupon Code in large text (for example, STANDARD 20), making it easy to read or copy, and provides a prominent REDEEM NOW button as the primary call-to-action for applying or using the offer.</p>
		<p>At the bottom of the card, a validity line (for example, “Valid till 30th May 2026”) clearly communicates the end date so users know whether the coupon is still usable. Overall, the combination of the Coupon List page and Coupon Detail Pop-up gives users a simple flow: browse all deals, tap one to see full details, then copy or redeem the code directly from the highlighted pop-up.</p>

	<h2>Checkout Page</h2>
	<p>Checkout page is the final confirmation and payment step after the Shopping Bag, where users provide their shipping details, enter payment information, review the final order summary, optionally add a donation, and read key policy notes before placing the order. The layout is split into a large form area on the left for address, payment methods/card details and a compact order summary column on the right, with donation and policy information displayed clearly at the bottom, so everything needed to complete the purchase is visible on a single screen.</p>
	<div class="ms-4">
		<h4>Page purpose and layout</h4>
		<p>The page shows a Back button link so users can return to the previous step if they want to change items in the cart, while a short note above the form reminds them to fill in details carefully to avoid delays. The main left section contains the Shipping/Delivery Address and Payment Information area, including card type/brand indicators, name on card, card number, expiration date, and CVV inputs, followed by the primary button (Apply/Pay) for submitting payment details. On the right, the Order Summary card lists each item (with quantity, dish name, and line price), then shows Delivery, Discount, Total, Tax, and final Order Total, along with a highlighted savings message that tells the user how much they are saving on this order</p>

		<h4>Coupon, notes, Cancellation Policy and confirmation areas</h4>
		<p>A Coupon Code field with an Apply button lets users enter a discount code directly from the checkout page, while a Description (Optional) text box allows them to add special delivery notes or instructions for the cloud kitchen or courier. Below the donation banner encourages users to “Donate to feeding India” with a fixed micro-donation amount (e.g., Rs 4) and an Add to Cart button, so they can quickly include a charitable contribution as part of the same transaction. By clicking on the Add to cart button, the system will update this in the order summary.</p>
		<p>The Cancellation Policy section explains how and when orders or subscriptions can be cancelled and how long refunds may take to process, and a final note at the bottom clarifies that prices are inclusive of taxes, meals are freshly prepared and delivered per schedule, and support contact details are available for any billing or payment issues.</p>

	<h2>Order Tracking Page</h2>
	<p>The Tracking Order page shows the live status of a single order after checkout and payment are completed, helping users understand what stage their order is in, when it is expected to arrive, and who is delivering it. At the top, a compact summary bar displays key details such as order placement time, total amount, expected delivery time, and the order number so users can quickly confirm they are viewing the correct order. Just below, a clear status label (for example, “Order Status: Order Placed”) and an estimated delivery timeline reinforce the current state and timing of the order.</p>
	<div class="ms-4">
		<h4>Order status timeline and map</h4>
		<p>A horizontal progress tracker visually represents the journey of the order across milestones like “Preparing order”, “At Pickup Point”, “Order Picked”, “On the way”, and “Delivered”, with completed steps highlighted and upcoming steps greyed out. This lets users instantly see how far along their order is and what will happen next. Below this, a confirmation block with a check icon and a map view(for visual tracking) communicates that the order has been accepted and is being prepared, along with a short confirmation message and a note that a confirmation email has been sent.</p>

		<h4>Delivery partner and customer information</h4>
		<p>A dedicated section introduces the delivery partner by name (for example, “Rahul is your Delivery Partner”) and includes a brief helper text along with a call icon so users understand they can tap to contact the rider for quick updates. The Customer Information panel consolidates customer details, billing address, and payment method (such as “Credit Card ending with 4242”), reassuring users that their order is tied to the correct profile, address, and payment source.</p>

		<h4>Order summary panel</h4>
		<p>On the right side, an Order Summary card recaps the items included in the order. It shows a thumbnail of the main dish (e.g., Baklava) with its description and price, followed by a list of all ordered items with quantities and line prices. And a cost breakdown presents Delivery, Discount, Total, Tax, and the final Order Total so users can verify that the charges match what they saw at checkout.</p>

		<h4>Overall experience</h4>
		<p>The status header, progress timeline, confirmation map, delivery partner info, customer details, and order summary make the tracking Order page a single place where users can see their confirmed order details, how far along it is, and know whom to contact if they need help, giving them clarity and reassurance while they wait for their delivery.</p>
	</div>

	<hr />

	<h2>Order Delivery Page</h2>
	<p>The Order Delivered page is the final state of the order-tracking flow, confirming that the user’s order has successfully reached its destination and capturing all important details in a receipt-style layout. At the top, the summary bar still shows when the order was placed, the total amount, promised delivery time, and the order number so users can easily cross‑check against earlier communication or support queries. The status label now reads “Order Status: Order Delivered”, and the horizontal timeline shows all stages—Preparing order, At Pickup Point, Order Picked, On the way, Delivered—as fully completed, giving a clear visual end to the journey.</p>
	<div class="ms-4">
		<h4>Delivery partner and confirmation section</h4>
		<p>Below the tracker, a section reiterates “Rahul is your Delivery Partner” (or the relevant name) with helper text explaining that the user can contact the partner if there is any issue with the delivered order, accompanied by a call icon for quick access. Further down, a confirmation panel labelled “Your Order is Delivered” reinforces that the order is complete. This panel includes a short explanatory message that the order has been accepted and delivered, that a confirmation email has been sent, and that users can return to this page for any post‑delivery references, closing the loop </p>

		<h4>Customer details and help</h4>
		<p>Under the confirmation area, the Customer Information card summarises key identity and billing data used for this order: customer name, delivery/billing address, and the payment method. This acts as a final reference for the user and for support in case of disputes or questions. At the very bottom of the page, a “Need Help? Contact Us” link provides a direct path to customer support, ensuring that users know exactly where to go if something about the delivered order is incorrect or missing.</p>

		<h4>Order summary and charges</h4>
		<p>The Order Summary card mirrors what the user saw at checkout, but is now marked as delivered. It highlights one of the ordered dishes with an image, name, short description, and its price, followed by a full list of all items, each with quantity and line price. Below the list, a breakdown shows Delivery, Discount, intermediate Total, Tax, and the final Order Total, with a large “DELIVERED” stamp graphic overlaid on the summary area to visually signal that no further changes can be made to this order. This clear breakdown lets users verify that the final charge matches what they expected at the time of payment.</p>

		<h4>Overall experience</h4>
		<p>With its completed status bar, delivery‑partner reminder, delivery confirmation message, compact customer information, help link, and sealed order summary, the Order Delivered page functions both as a reassurance screen and as a permanent digital receipt. Users can revisit it from their order history to remember what they ordered, how much they paid, when it was delivered, and whom to contact if they ever need post‑delivery assistance.</p>
	</div>

	<hr />

	<h2>Review pop-up (Post-Delivery Rating)</h2>
	<p>The Review Pop-up appears as a centred overlay after an order has been marked delivered, inviting users to rate their experience while the delivery is still fresh in mind. At the top, a large green check icon and bold “Thank You!” message confirm that the food was delivered successfully, followed by a short line such as “You got your food delivered at Shidori” to clearly link the feedback request to the just-completed order. The pop-up asks two questions: “How would you rate your experience at Shidori?” and “How would you rate our Delivery Partner Shidori?”, each paired with a 5‑star rating control so users can separately evaluate the overall Shidori experience and the delivery partner’s performance.</p>
	<p>Under the star ratings, a “Write your comment” text box lets users leave optional written feedback about food quality, packaging, punctuality, or delivery behaviour. At the bottom, a prominent Submit button sends the selected star ratings and comment, and a closing line explains that “Your ratings will help other privileged members in discovering better places,” reinforcing that their feedback benefits the whole community.</p>

					<li>The Order History section is accessed from the left-side Profile menu and shows a list or grid of all orders that have already been delivered to the user.​</li>
					<li>Each entry focuses on completed orders, so users can quickly review what they have previously ordered and how much they paid.​</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="ms-4">
					<h5>Order cards in Order History</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Every order is represented as a card containing key details such as Order ID, delivery date and time, main items, total quantity, and total price.​</li>

					</ul>

					<h5>Showing existing rating on Item Delivered page</h5>

					</ul>

					<h5>Updating an existing rating</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Alongside the displayed rating, an action such as “Edit Rating” or an editable star control is shown so that the user can update their feedback if their opinion changes.​</li>
						<li>Clicking this action takes the user back to the Rating page, with their previous rating and review pre‑filled in the form, so they only need to adjust the parts they want to change.​</li>
						<li>After the user resubmits the updated rating, the revised stars and review text are saved and immediately reflected again on the Item Delivered page and, where relevant, in the Customer Reviews area.</li>
